# barebones-xmonad-
My minimal xmonad configuration.

This is a very barebones configuration, if you are very minimalist and love older interfaces, you may like this config.

There is a very small amount of additions with bindings, these can be easily tailored to your set-up, and very compatible between really any distro or branch of Linux or BSD with few tweaks or changes necessary.

The Fibronacci and Grid Layout is added by default, and trayer is positioned for the position and same color as the bar, along with just some SpawnOnce instances for programs at start time, be sure to look over this and the key binds and change to your liking.
